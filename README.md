# CMPT_306
This repository contains my individual project for cmpt306. It has the unity source code, executable, & final report.

# Project Info
The purpose of this project was to simulate buyancy in 3D using vectors.

# Controls
I borrowed a flycam script (which I called FlyCamScript.cs) from http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/FlyCam_Extended. The controls for the flycam are listed below:

    WASD/Arrows:    Movement
              Q:    Climb
          Shift:    Move faster
        Control:    Move slower
            End:    Toggle cursor locking to screen (you can also press Ctrl+P to toggle play mode on and off).
         Camera:    Mouse cursor movement

There are additional controls that I implemented to generate objects, increase/decrease object mass, & throw the object. These are listed onscreen in the bottom left corner of the screen of the simulation, but I will list them here as well.

    Generate Objects
            Cube:   c
          Sphere:   s
        Cylinder:   y 
      Rect.Prism:   r
      
    Actions
       Throw Obj:   space
     Change Mass:   -/+
